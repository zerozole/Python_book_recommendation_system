This project is based on a book recommendation system. 

The dataset has three CSV files, each for users, ratings, and books. I load the data and then do the preprocessing, where I clean the data and do feature engineering.
Then I do data visualization to understand the data at hand. I prepared my recommendation system based on both memory-based collaborative filtering using cosine similarity and model-based collaborative filtering using singular value decomposition. 

The found RSME founded for both the models are mentioned.
